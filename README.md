Grafeas + in-toto
=================

This repository provides an interface that converts standard in-toto link files
into Grafeas occurrences, and vice versa, in an in-toto-verifiable manner.
Grafeas supports in-toto attestations as a note and occurrence kind since
v0.1.6. However, the format of the document supported in Grafeas is slightly
different from the default attestations generated by the in-toto reference
implementations.

## Use

To convert an in-toto link into a Grafeas in-toto occurrence:

```python
from totoify_grafeas.totoifylib import GrafeasInTotoOccurrence
GrafeasInTotoOccurrence.from_link(in_toto_link, step_name, resource_uri)
```

This interface will return a Grafeas in-toto occurrence, which can be stored in
a Grafeas server using typical methods.

To convert a Grafeas in-toto occurrence into an in-toto link:

```python
from totoify_grafeas.totoifylib import GrafeasInTotoOccurrence
g = GrafeasInTotoOccurrence.load(path)
g.to_link(step_name)
```

This interface will return an in-toto link, which can be used to perform in-toto
verification.

Planned Features:
- A Grafeas transport - this would allow users to send a Grafeas in-toto
  occurrence to a specified Grafeas server
- Grafeas occurrence generation in the referece implementation - the option to
  generate a Grafeas occurrence in the in-toto Python implementation instead of
  the traditional links
